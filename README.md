# Vehicle Detection System (VDS)

The **Vehicle Detection System (VDS)** is a two-part application that manages vehicle detection and access control for parking lot entrances.

It includes:

1. **User Interface (UI) Component**  
   A Next.js-based frontend that handles user authentication, vehicle registration, and viewing detection records.

2. **Machine Learning (ML) Component**  
   Detects vehicles in video feeds, extracts details, and stores them in a database.

- Extracted vehicle details:
  - **Make & Model**
  - **Color**
  - **Number Plate**
- Integration with Supabase for storing detection records.
- Automatic barrier control:
  - **Registered vehicles**: Barrier lifts.
  - **Unregistered vehicles**: Access denied.
- Built using:
  - **Ultralytics** ‚Äì YOLO Library
  - **OpenCV** ‚Äì Vehicle Extraction
  - **PyTorch** ‚Äì Training Machine Learning Models

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Python 3.13+
- Supabase account and project
- `.env` files for both components

---

### üñ•Ô∏è UI Component Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the UI directory:

   ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=<Your Supabase Database URL>
    DIRECT_URL=<Your Supabase Database Direct URL>
    ACCESS_SECRET=<Random String>
    REFRESH_SECRET=<Random String>
    SECURE=<HTTPS Status>
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**

   ```bash
    npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Build the UI Component**

   ```bash
    npm run build
   ```

5. **Run the UI Component**
   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

### üîß ML Component Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the ML directory:

   ```bash
   SUPABASE_URL=<Your Supabase URL>
   SUPABASE_KEY=<Your Supabase API Key>
   COM=<Connection Port>
   ```

3. **Run the ML Component**
   ```bash
   python "FrontCamera.py"
   ```

---

## üîç How It Works

- The ML component detects and identifies vehicles from video streams and stores this data in Supabase.

- The UI allows users to register and associate vehicles with their accounts.

- When a vehicle is detected:

  - If registered, the barrier opens.

  - If not, access is denied.
